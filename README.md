‼️DISCLAIMER:
**IGNORE** what the in-game Video Settings say! It's going to say "2560x1440" blah blah..
The menu environment will look lower res, but the text should be crisp. Go in-game and you'll see that it worked!  
(the game resolution is based off **what your current desktop resolution** is set to!!)
